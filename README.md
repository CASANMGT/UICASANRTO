## 📈 Operational Intelligence

The Programs dashboard uses data-driven logic to evaluate scheme performance.

### ⚖️ Collection Health Logic
Collection health represents the ratio of **performing** vs **non-performing** assets within a scheme.
- **Formula:** `(Active Units / Total Assigned Units) × 100`
- **[Performing] Healthy Active:** Assets with positive credit balance (`active`).
- **[Non-Performing]:** Assets in `grace` (expired credit) or `immobilized` (locked/non-payment).

**Executive Benchmarks:**
- **● GOOD (>95%):** Operational Excellence. Payments are synchronized with daily usage.
- **● WARNING (90-95%):** Risk Alert. Requires immediate collection rigor and rider follow-up.
- **● CRITICAL (<90%):** Intervention Phase. Review rider risk profiles and consider asset recovery.

### 🏗️ Fleet Maturity Logic
Maturity reflects the average equity recovery across the program's lifecycle.
- **Formula:** `Average(RTO Progress %)` across all assigned vehicles.
- **0-25% (Early):** Growth & deployment phase. High upfront capital exposure.
- **25-75% (Mid):** Operational stability phase. Positive cashflow recovery.
- **>75% (High):** Impending ownership transfer. Final lifecycle stage.

## 🗂️ Data Model (Mock / Generated)

All data is generated client-side in `store.js` — no backend required.

| Entity | Key Fields |
|--------|-----------|
| **Vehicle** | `id`, `status`, `programId`, `partnerId`, `credits`, `bearing`, `speed`, `isOnline`, `isRunning`, `rider`, `plate` |
| **User** | `userId`, `name`, `gender` (90% M / 10% F), `nik`, `phone`, `riskLabel`, `vehicleId` (Strict 1:1) |
| **Transaction** | `id`, `vehicleId`, `date`, `amount`, `method`, `status`, `creditDays` (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 15) |
| **GPS Device** | `id`, `imei`, `vehicleId`, `vehiclePlate`, `sim`, `status`, `lat`, `lng` |
| **Program** | `id`, `name`, `type` (RTO/Rent), `price/day`, `graceDays` (Standardized to 1) |
| **Partner** | `id`, `name`, `color` |
